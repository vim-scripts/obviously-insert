This script will change the colour of both the status bar and background when you enter and exit insert mode so no more typing : in the middle of your code.

You can choose the colours to use right at the top of the script.

Credits: Many people on irc://irc.freenode.org in #vim.

Special Credits:
godlygeek - Answered so many of my questions I lost count.
Dave Kirby - Pointing out version 0.5 was broken with gvim in GUI mode and why.

I deleted the previous versions because they are broken in some (benign) way so you shouldn't use them.
